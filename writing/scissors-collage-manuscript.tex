\section{Introduction}

\section{Algorithm}
We begin by accepting an uploaded photo (``target'') and a search term used to retrieve a second photo (``base''). Then, using \cite[Georg Fischer's triangulation algorithm]{https://snorpey.github.io/triangulation/} we split each image into polygons $P_{base}, P_{target}$ comprised of Delaunay triangles. Next we use \cite[k-means]{k-means} to cluster the colors in each photo and select the top $k=5$ most important colors in each photo. The two sets $Colors_{base}, Colors_{target}$ of cardinality $k$  are then assigned a one to one mapping, $\phi$, using weighted bipartite matching. \\
Now, for both photos, we color each triangle using the \hyperref[sec:algorithm1]{color redistribution algorithm} equal areas for all $k$ colors across all triangles. Given these equally distributed colors we now recolor each triangle from $color_i\in Colors_{base}$ to $color_{\phi(i)}\in Colors_{target}$. \\
Finally, we use scissors congruence to recreate $P_{target}$ from $P_{base}$. 

\subsection{Color Redistribution Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm1}
For each triangle we compute its average color and then color it with the closest of the $k$ colors found while clustering the target image. Then we begin to balance the total area of each color, by creating $k$ bins with an area threshold of $T=(Total Area)/k$, where each bin corresponds to a color. Now, for a given bin $B$, if B's total area $Area_B>T$ we consider the smallest triangle $t_{min} \in B$ and check whether it could be removed from $B$ while maintaining $Area_B>T$. If $t_min$ can be removed in this way we recolor $t_min$ to the closest bin that is not yet full. If $t_min$ cannot be removed without $Area_B<T$ we instead consider the largest triangle $t_{max}\in B$. We divide $t_max$ into two smaller triangles by drawing a ray from a vertex such that one of the new triangles $t_max'$ has area $Area_B-T$ and recolor $t_max'$ as described above.
