This is just a quick little implementation of [Delaunay Triangulation][1] in
JavaScript. It was mostly ported from [Paul Bourke's C implementation][2], but
I referenced some bits from [another JavaScript implementation][3] and rewrote
a bunch of things in ways more amenable to fast JavaScript execution.

Notably, it runs in subquadratic time, making it the fastest JavaScript
implementation of which I'm aware. (Okay, it doesn't really, but it'd be
trivial to modify to run in subquadratic time, I just havn't done so yet.)
